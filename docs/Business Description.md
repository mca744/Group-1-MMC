"Pete Buttigieg is the current United States Secretary of Transportation. He has been in this role since January 20, 2021. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is a federal agency that is responsible for security at airports and other transportation hubs.

Buttigieg has been critical of the TSA in the past, saying that it is "not as effective as it could be." He has also said that the TSA needs to do a better job of balancing security with efficiency."

"Here are some of the things that Buttigieg has done to address the problems at the TSA:

He has increased the number of TSA officers at airports.
He has implemented new technologies to speed up the screening process."

"There is some evidence that TSA throughput can be correlated with weather. For example, a study by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) found that throughput at airports tends to be lower on days when there is bad weather, such as thunderstorms or heavy rain."
"Another study, conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, found that TSA throughput can also be correlated with temperature. The study found that throughput tends to be lower on days when it is very hot or very cold. This is likely because people are less likely to travel on days when the weather is extreme."

While these factors having affect on air travel are obvious, cargo shipping efficieny is a complete seperate factor to consider for airline businesses. 

Harnessing correlations and analytic insight drawn from Tableau - connected to these csv's through a Driver - marketers and service operation managers can have the option of another tool that ay present data in other visualzing ways than say "Data Analytic Solver" (A Microsoft Excel Extension).
