What can anyone do with TSA data that Pete Buttigieg can't?

Our business can rely on TSA flights and the weather to closely detect patterns of when to possibly advertise a small business around certain airports. Some 60% of small business owners self-identify as Republicans. Directly targeting Republican-lead small businesses that are located around airports to make use of our product, may translate to a very inexpensive additional service to only enhance a small busineses' marketing plan. We can harness AWS cloud computing to use in real time data, as well as make weather api calls to predict flight traffic. That or by relying on past records, have an easily assessible app to sync with an advertising campaign that a business may undertake. (Potential may be limited by too many Venture capital firms and influential tech grads filling the markets with the same exact ideas. Though, what would set out app apart will be our salespeople. Think of how many celeb-inspired liquors are on the market... and the salespeople behind companies who turn any celeb alocohol into a number one selling liquour. Teamwork - or specifically - salespeople should not be overlooked. They are as every bit as contributing as the makers/creators/designors behind any process.

If market is limited in the U.S., there certainly is room most anywhere else in the world - which may also find an app like this - as something practical. This could be low cost to make and implement... and potentially has room to be bundled with other services - like licensed music that's held in a library or catalogue - that may play throughout one's business. (Think Trader Joe's music licensing.)

Employees/salespeople will possibly build repetoire and a reputation for this business. This is truly what sets any business apart. It's not just number crunching or some idea, it is also the work of personal relationship building. That is what holds as much value as any cent invested into any business. Busines comes down the basics of likeability. (Think Mark Cuban selling Sports to Yahoo.)

People can benefit if they see themselves as active participants in the process of cold-calling small businesses and asking around for interest or to sample this product. Baby Boomers and Gen X picked up their phones and made calls to small businesses without the help of Big banking... So, going back to basics and without the help of A.I. or automation, selling and pitching this comes down to the effort of anyone involved who wants to put the task of contracting with businesses, on their backs.

Additionally, there will be room to also expand with a feedback-loop sales model. We can balance the responsibility of knowing precise logistics of your business by giving insight back to any of our customers. Did our predictions correlate to more growth? Were we accurate in our assessments? Our feedback provided will show just that. We can help draw corrlelations of weather patterns and sales growth to increase revenues and profitability, just as most any Google or Microsoft-engineered analystics algorithm could.

To repeat, this would all be held on an easily viewable platform with a customer rep. available 24/7 - as this is a small company starting out with a few college students. College student sales representatives would be our biggest asset. Being passionate about and standing behind a company that you are more a part of (like think co-op companies... WinCo Food... AceHardware... Lowes) instills a different sense of the sort of environment and atmosphere that employees help create.

Our fresh college-grads could also respresent metros/regions where their home base airports are located too. This personability would only strengthen local small businesses with actual people who have hands-on experience with their local economic climates. Google founders went door-to-door around San Jose, mapping their business (or so Is publishes - to be believed?) to creating a company at the heights of all heights...

A company like this could perhaps even use what is already available by Google -themsleves. The difference, still, comes down to who will be going business to business or doing the cold-calling to sell this product for practical use.

Laslty, businesses would be left with the confidence that they wouldn't only be buying into a marketing app, though will also have access to low-cost marketing consultation by college computer science/marketing analytic undergrad/grad students.
